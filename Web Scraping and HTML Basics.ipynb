    "# **Introduction to web scraping**\n",
    "Web scraping, also known as web harvesting or web data extraction, is the process of extracting information from websites or web pages. It involves automated retrieval of data from web sources. \n",
    "People use it for various applications such as data analysis, mining, price comparison, content aggregation, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How web scraping works\n",
    "### HTTP request\n",
    "The process typically begins with an HTTP request. A web scraper sends an HTTP request to a specific URL, similar to how a web browser would when you visit a website. The request is usually an HTTP GET request, which retrieves the web page's content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web page retrieval\n",
    "The web server hosting the website responds to the request by returning the requested web page's HTML content. This content includes the visible text and media elements and the underlying HTML structure that defines the page's layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTML parsing\n",
    "Once the HTML content is received, you need to parse the content. Parsing involves breaking down the HTML structure into components, such as tags, attributes, and text content. You can use BeautifulSoup in Python. It creates a structured representation of the HTML content that can be easily navigated and manipulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data extraction\n",
    "With the HTML content parsed, web scrapers can now identify and extract the specific data they need. This data can include text, links, images, tables, product prices, news articles, and more. Scrapers locate the data by searching for relevant HTML tags, attributes, and patterns in the HTML structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data transformation\n",
    "Extracted data may need further processing and transformation. For instance, you can remove HTML tags from text, convert data formats, or clean up messy data. This step ensures the data is ready for analysis or other use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storage\n",
    "After extraction and transformation, you can store the scraped data in various formats, such as databases, spreadsheets, JSON, or CSV files. The choice of storage format depends on the specific project's requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automation\n",
    "In many cases, scripts or programs automate web scraping. These automation tools allow recurring data extraction from multiple web pages or websites. Automated scraping is especially useful for collecting data from dynamic websites that regularly update their content."
