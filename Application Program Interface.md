       Understanding APIs
- An API allows different software components to communicate, similar to how functions work with inputs and outputs.
- The pandas library serves as an example, where data is processed through its API to perform operations like calculating means or displaying data.

REST APIs Overview
- REST APIs enable communication over the internet, allowing access to resources and data.
- The client (your program) sends requests to a web service (resource) via HTTP methods, typically using JSON files for data transmission.
